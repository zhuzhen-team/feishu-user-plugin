## [1.3.6] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Upload completeness**: `uploadDocMedia` → `uploadMedia` accepting 8 `parent_type`s (docx / sheet / bitable × image / file + legacy doc_*). New `create_doc_block` modes for files (`file_path` / `file_token`, block_type 23, auto view-wrap). `update_doc_block` accepts `file_token` to swap existing file blocks. New `upload_drive_file` (`drive/v1/files/upload_all`; optional `wiki_space_id` auto-attaches via `move_docs_to_wiki`). New `upload_bitable_attachment` (`parent_type=bitable_image|bitable_file`).
- **`batch_send` tool**: fan-out the same or different content to multiple targets in one call. Each target dispatches sequentially with anti-rate-limit throttling and reports per-target `ok` / `error`. Identity is the cookie user unless `target.via=bot`.
- **Multi-profile support**: `list_profiles` / `switch_profile` tools + `LARK_PROFILES_JSON` env. Hot-swap credentials without restarting the MCP server; cached client instances rebuild against the new profile.
- **`send_card_as_user` (bot-routed default)**: send Feishu interactive cards. v1.3.6 routes through the bot identity; the `as_user` suffix is reserved for v1.3.7's reverse-engineered cookie path. `via="user"` returns an explicit not-yet-implemented error.

### Changed
- OAuth scopes added: `drive:file:upload` (narrower scope for `drive/v1/files/upload_all`), `sheets:spreadsheet` (sheet image / file uploads). Existing users must re-run `npx feishu-user-plugin oauth` to pick them up.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Cross-process UAT refresh lock**: file lock at `~/.claude/feishu-uat-refresh.lock` (`O_CREAT|O_EXCL`, 30s stale detection) serializes UAT refresh across concurrent MCP processes. Inside the critical section, the lock holder re-reads `~/.claude.json` to see whether a peer already rotated the token; if so it adopts the fresh one. Closes the "Codex spawned 6 MCP servers, all raced to refresh" failure mode that was burning refresh tokens on 2026-04-23.
- **`get_login_status` UAT health check**: now actually exercises the UAT (calls `listChatsAsUser({pageSize:1})`) instead of just checking presence. Surfaces "configured but 401" cases that previously stayed silent until the next real tool call.

### Added
- **Bot-fallback ⚠️ warning**: every write tool that silently fell back from UAT to bot identity (`create_doc` / `create_bitable` / `create_folder` / `create_doc_block` / etc.) now appends a `fallbackWarning` to the response so users see the ownership change immediately. Before, callers only learned days later when a teammate could read their "private" resource.
- **Auto-expand `merge_forward`**: `read_messages` / `read_p2p_messages` walk a `merge_forward` placeholder into its child messages by default (`expand_merge_forward=false` to opt out). Children carry `parentMessageId` (use that, NOT the child id, when downloading their media). Text children get `urls[]` + `feishuDocs[]` extracted so agents can feed them straight into `read_doc` / WebFetch.
- **`download_file` tool**: download a file attachment (`msg_type=file`). Returns base64 + mimeType + byte count; optional `save_path` writes to disk. Same parent-id rule for `merge_forward` children as `download_image`.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Wiki-hosted content is now first-class**: every docx and bitable tool accepts the `document_id` / `app_token` parameter in three forms — native token (unchanged), wiki node token (`wikcnXXX` / `wikmXXX` / `wiknXXX`), or a full Feishu URL (`https://xxx.feishu.cn/docx/XXX`, `.../wiki/XXX`, `.../base/XXX`). A new `src/resolver.js` parses the input, calls `wiki/v2/spaces/get_node` when needed to resolve to `obj_token` + `obj_type`, and caches the mapping for 10 min. Zero-lookup path for direct URLs.
- **`get_wiki_node` tool**: explicitly resolves a Wiki node to its backing object (`obj_type` + `obj_token` + `space_id`). Useful when you need to branch behaviour on whether a node points at a docx, bitable, sheet, mindnote, file, or slides.
- **Create docx / bitable directly under Wiki**: `create_doc` / `create_bitable` accept optional `wiki_space_id` (and `wiki_parent_node_token` for nested placement). Plugin creates the resource in drive, then calls `wiki/v2/spaces/{space_id}/nodes/move_docs_to_wiki` to attach it. Returns `wikiNodeToken` on success, `wikiAttachTaskId` when Feishu queues the move, or a warning if attach fails (resource still in drive).
- **Docx image read**: `download_image` now has a docx mode — pass `image_token` (from `get_doc_blocks` image block) and optional `doc_token` (native / wiki node / URL). Routes through `drive/v1/medias/{token}/download`, returns base64 as MCP image content so the model sees the pixels.
- **Docx image write**: `create_doc_block` gains two shortcut parameters — `image_path` (local file) automatically runs the three-step Feishu flow (create empty image block → upload via `drive/v1/medias/upload_all` with `parent_type=docx_image` and the new block_id → patch with `replace_image`); `image_token` reuses an already-uploaded media token. `update_doc_block` accepts `image_token` to swap the picture in an existing image block.
- **`list_user_okrs` / `get_okrs` / `list_okr_periods` tools**: read a user's OKRs, batch fetch full objective + key result details (progress, alignments, mentions), and enumerate periods. UAT-first with app fallback when the OKR scope is granted.
- **`list_calendars` / `list_calendar_events` / `get_calendar_event` tools**: list the user's calendars (primary / shared / subscribed), list events in a time window, and fetch full event details (attendees, location, meeting links, attachments).

### Fixed
- **External-group `read_messages` hardening**: new `src/error-codes.js` classifies bot failures. Known-needs-UAT codes (`240001` external tenant, `70009` no permission, `70003` / `99991668` bot not in chat, `19001` chat not found) hop straight to UAT. Transient codes (`42101` rate limit, `5xx`, `ECONNRESET`, fetch timeouts) retry once after a 2 s delay before falling back. Response now includes `via: "bot" | "user" | "contacts"` and, when fallback fires, `via_reason` (e.g. `bot_external_tenant`). When the `chat_id` was discovered via `search_contacts` (i.e. definitely external) the bot path is skipped entirely.
- **Raw Feishu payload no longer leaks when UAT is missing**: bot failures with no UAT configured now produce `Cannot read chat <id> as bot (<reason>). To read external/private groups, configure UAT via: npx feishu-user-plugin oauth` — previously the caller got the unwrapped Feishu error JSON.
- **`_uatREST` array query params**: OKR / calendar endpoints that take repeated query keys (e.g. `period_ids=p1&period_ids=p2`) now serialize correctly. Previously `URLSearchParams(query)` would call `toString` on arrays and produce CSV, which Feishu rejects.

### Changed
- Tool count 67 → **74** (+7: `get_wiki_node`, `list_user_okrs`, `get_okrs`, `list_okr_periods`, `list_calendars`, `list_calendar_events`, `get_calendar_event`).
- `getWikiNode(nodeToken, _spaceId)` — `spaceId` parameter position swapped; retained only for backward-compatibility of any external caller. The endpoint itself ignores `space_id`.
- `create_doc_block` no longer requires `children` — callers who use the new `image_path` or `image_token` shortcut omit it. One of `children` / `image_path` / `image_token` must be provided.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **MCP mid-session disconnect (root fix)**: All raw `fetch` calls to Feishu now go through `fetchWithTimeout` (AbortController, 30s default). A stalled connection used to hang a tool handler indefinitely; the MCP client would time out and some clients tore down the stdio transport — observed as "MCP 中途掉线" on v1.3.2. This was the real cause, not just the v1.3.1 stdout pollution.
- **stdout pollution (defense-in-depth)**: `src/index.js` now globally redirects `console.log` / `console.info` to stderr at startup, before any other `require`. Any current or future dependency that accidentally writes to stdout can no longer corrupt the JSON-RPC channel. (v1.3.1's Lark-SDK-specific logger override stays as-is.)
- **`(as user)` label lied for docs/bitable/folder creation**: `create_doc` / `create_bitable` / `create_folder` previously labeled every successful call `(as user)` whenever `LARK_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN` was set, even when the UAT call actually failed and silently fell back to app identity. `_asUserOrApp` now threads a real `_viaUser` flag through; failures show `(as app — UAT unavailable or failed; <resource> owned by the app, not you)`.

### Added
- **APP_ID startup validation**: MCP server probes `/auth/v3/app_access_token/internal` at boot. Invalid `LARK_APP_ID` / `LARK_APP_SECRET` (wrong-tenant, stale, or hallucinated by an autoinstall) now produce a clear stderr error pointing at the team-skills install prompt. Non-blocking — users running cookie-only workflows are unaffected.
- **`get_login_status` shows app identity**: Now returns the actual `app_id` plus fetched app name, so users can immediately spot "this isn't my team's app" scenarios.
- **`download_image` tool**: Download an image embedded in a message by `message_id` + `image_key`, returned as MCP image content so the model can see the pixels (not just the key string). Tries UAT first (works for any chat the user is in); falls back to app token (requires the bot to be in the chat).

### Changed
- Tool count 66 → **67** (added `download_image`).
- README tool badge corrected from 76 → 67 (previous 76 was stale and never matched the actual export).

## [1.1.3] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Case-insensitive chat name matching**: All name resolution strategies (bot group list, im.chat.search, search_contacts) now use case-insensitive matching. "ai技术解决" now correctly matches "AI技术解决（内部）".
- **expires_in NaN bug**: UAT token refresh and OAuth now validate `expires_in` field, defaulting to 7200s if missing/invalid, preventing NaN corruption in config.
- **_populateSenderNames inefficiency**: Fixed redundant condition in cookie-based name fallback.
- **OAuth silent persistence failure**: Now logs warnings when token persistence to `~/.claude.json` fails, instead of silently swallowing errors.
- **Null safety**: Added null check in `resolveToOcId` for undefined chat_id.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Double OAuth on first install**: `oauth.js` now writes tokens to both `.env` and `~/.claude.json` MCP config directly, so MCP restart picks them up immediately without needing a second OAuth run.
- **readMessagesAsUser fails with start_time but no end_time**: Auto-sets `end_time` to current timestamp when `start_time` is provided but `end_time` is not, preventing "end_time earlier than start_time" error.
- **read_p2p_messages rejects chat names**: Now resolves user/group names automatically via search_contacts.
- **External group messages show sender IDs instead of names**: `_populateSenderNames` now falls back to cookie-based user identity lookup for external tenant users.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **read_messages can't read external groups**: `read_messages` now auto-falls back to UAT when bot API fails (e.g. bot not in group, external groups). No need to manually switch to `read_p2p_messages`.
- **Chat name resolution for external groups**: Added Strategy 3 using `search_contacts` (cookie-based) to find groups not visible to bot or `im.chat.search`.
- **Numeric chat IDs not accepted by read_messages**: `resolveToOcId` now passes through numeric IDs directly.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **read_messages 400 error hidden**: Now shows actual Feishu error code and description instead of just "Request failed with status code 400"
- **Messages returned oldest first**: Default sort is now `ByCreateTimeDesc` (newest messages first) for both `read_messages` and `read_p2p_messages`
- **Chat name resolution**: Added `im.v1.chat.search` API as fallback when bot's group list doesn't contain the target chat
- **get_user_info fails for external users**: Added official contact API fallback (`contact.user.get`) for cross-tenant user lookup
- **Messages lack sender names**: `read_messages` and `read_p2p_messages` now auto-resolve sender IDs to display names
- **UAT persistence writes to npx temp dir**: Now persists refreshed tokens to `~/.claude.json` MCP config instead
- **oauth-auto.js missing offline_access scope**: Added `offline_access` to SCOPES (was missing, causing no refresh_token)
- **README "8 slash commands"**: Corrected to "9 slash commands" (was missing /drive)
- **CLAUDE.md false "type: stdio" warning**: Removed — `"type": "stdio"` is standard and harmless in Claude Code

### Added
- `sort_type` parameter for `read_messages` and `read_p2p_messages` (`ByCreateTimeDesc` / `ByCreateTimeAsc`)
- `senderName` field in message results (auto-resolved from sender ID)
- CLI subcommands: `npx feishu-user-plugin setup` (wizard), `oauth`, `status`
- `src/cli.js` — CLI dispatcher for subcommands
- `src/setup.js` — Interactive setup wizard (writes MCP config, validates credentials)
- `chatSearch()` method in official client (uses `im.v1.chat.search`)
- `getUserById()` method with caching for user name resolution
- `_safeSDKCall()` wrapper that extracts real Feishu errors from Lark SDK AxiosErrors
- `_populateSenderNames()` for batch sender name resolution in message lists

### Changed
- `package.json` bin entry points to `src/cli.js` (supports subcommands, default still starts MCP server)
- team-skills README rewritten for pure npm flow (no clone needed)
- CLAUDE.md OAuth instructions updated to use `npx feishu-user-plugin oauth`
- Error messages across all 33 tools now include actual Feishu error codes

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-10
